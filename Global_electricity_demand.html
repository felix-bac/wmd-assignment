            <img src="./img/A.I's Electric Energy Hunger Image Apr 29, 2025, 03_46_37 PM (1).png" alt="Global Electricity Demand Surges, Ushering in a New Energy-Hungry Era" class="story-image">

            <p>The world is experiencing a record increase in electricity demand driven by rapid industrialization, transportation electrification, and unabated expansion of data centers and artificial intelligence (AI). The global demand for electricity increased by 4.3% in 2024, close to double the decade-average growth rate, and will increase by 4% per year to 2027, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) Electricity 2025 report states. This "thirst for electricity" is reshaping power systems, straining grids, and leading the shift towards renewables, and putting energy security and emissions on the agenda.</p>

            <p class="header1">A New Age of Electricity</p>

            <p>The IEA has called this growth the start of a "new Age of Electricity," with demand set to grow until 2027. Emerging economies China and India are at the forefront for most of the growth, with 85% of incremental demand. China contributed 54% of the world's growth in 2024 because of energy-intensive manufacturing of clean energy technology, increasing ownership of air conditioners, and data center and 5G network build-out. India's peak demand will increase 8% in 2025 because of economic growth and heatwave-driven cooling demand, with air conditioning contributing 60 GW to peak load in 2024.</p>

            <p>"The pace of global electricity demand is highlighting the deep transformation underway in energy systems," said Keisuke Sadamori, IEA Director of Energy Markets and Security. "It is presenting evolving challenges to governments in providing secure, affordable, and sustainable electricity supply."</p>

            <p class="header1">Main Drivers of the Energy Insatiable Demand</p>

            <p>Several drivers are fueling this insatiable demand for electricity:</p>

            <p>Transport Electrification: EV sales gathered pace globally in 2024, with China leading at 40% compound annual growth rate, driven by plug-in hybrids and extended-range EVs. The US grew at 10% on the back of new product introductions and tax incentives. EVs will add 20 million units globally in 2025, a further 4% to electricity consumption growth.</p>

            <p>Data Centers and AI Boom: Data centers consumed an estimated 460 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity globally in 2022, which will rise over 1,000 TWh by 2026â€”the entire yearly consumption of Japan. AI, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency development are powering the boom with Rystad Energy predicting data center demand to 860 TWh by 2030.</p>

            <p>Cooling Demand: The record hot year in 2024 raised cooling demand by 6% in 2024 compared to 2023. In India alone, 14 million air conditioners were sold in 2024, 27% higher than in 2023, with cooling to account for one-third of peak load by 2030.</p>

            <p>Industrial Electrification: Electrical systems are replacing fossil fuel-heated industries throughout China's light industries like electronics and textiles. This replacement, as well as expanded production of clean energy, is adding to the electricity intensity of industry segments.</p>

            <p>X posts are like-minded in tone, with authors accrediting that demand for electricity is growing at a rate twice that for overall energy consumption, driven by AI, data centers, and growing affluence everywhere.</p>

            <p class="header1">Renewables Pick Up the Slack</p>

            <p>The positive news is that low-emissions sources, dominated by renewables and nuclear, are covering the lion's share of that demand. Renewables and nuclear covered 80% of the world's growth in electricity generation in 2024, led by solar photovoltaic (PV). Solar production doubled over the last three years, surpassing coal in the EU in 2024, and will cover half of global growth demand through 2027.</p>

            <p>The planet installed a fresh record of 700 gigawatts of renewable capacity in the year 2024, solar and wind to supply 90% of power demand growth in 2025. Renewables will replace coal as a source of electricity generation by early 2025, generating 35% of global electricity, from 30% in 2023. Nuclear power also returned to the competition with new production records annually beginning 2025.</p>

            <p>Fossil fuels are not yet letting go either. Coal generation was flat in 2024 due to robust demand, particularly in Asia, and natural gas increased to fill peak loads, particularly in the U.S., where it provided 43% of electricity in 2024.</p>

            <p class="header1">Challenges and Risks</p>

            <p>The unexpected spike in electricity demand is straining grids and exposing vulnerabilities. Supply chain disruption, particularly of transformers, has extended lead times to 120 weeks in 2024, slowing grid modernization. Catastrophic weather, which totaled $53 billion in the United States in 2024, is also testing infrastructure.</p>

            <p>Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the power sector increased 1.6% in 2024 to an all-time high of 14.6 billion tonnes on the back of fossil fuel-based electricity generation to meet heatwave-driven demand. In the absence of the warmer temperatures, however, fossil growth would have been only 0.2%, with clean energy meeting 96% of weather-independent demand. The IEA anticipates a plateau in 2025 for emissions but the possibility of a decline if hydropower and renewables keep growing.</p>

            <p>Negative wholesale electricity prices as a result of renewable intermittency are also becoming a problem. There were record-length periods of negative prices in certain markets in 2024, and it is looking forward to the need for high-level energy storage systems like batteries, the deployment of which doubled in 2023.</p>

            <p class="header1">A Way Forward</p>

            <p>To fulfill this hunger for energy in a clean manner, experts are suggesting a range of things to do:</p>

            <p>Grid Modernization: Transmission and distribution infrastructure investment, estimated to reach $174 billion in the United States alone by 2024, must be able to accommodate renewables and ensure reliability.</p>

            <p>Energy Storage: Advanced battery technology and smart grid use are required for peak load management and storing intermittent renewable energy.</p>

            <p>Efficiency Measures: Efficiency solutions on the demand side like efficient appliances and smart meters can avoid wasteful usage.</p>

            <p>Policy Support: Bankable policies, accelerated permits, and power purchase agreements can help clean energy finance at a cheaper rate.</p>

            <p>The World Economic Forum cites that no single technology will suffice to address this need and requires a combination of power in addition to renewables, nuclear, and smart grids.</p>

            <p class="header1">The Road Ahead</p>

            <p>The world's appetite for electricity is a hallmark of profound transformation toward an electrified economy, with electricity as the lifeblood of new industry, transportation, and lifestyle. While renewables and nuclear are rising to the challenge, the ongoing role of fossil fuels and infrastructure constraints are an indication of the complexity of the process. As IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol has said, "Electricity use is growing rapidly, pulling overall energy demand along with it."</p>

            <p>As new markets power growth and new technologies like EVs and AI reinvent the consumption playbook, 2025 will be the year when growth and sustainability collide. Whether the world's ability to scale clean energy, grid modernize, and limit emissions will make this decade of high energy hunger a decade of innovation victories or a story of overreach remains to be seen.</p>
